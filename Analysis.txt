
Conclusions/comparisons
	
1. The larger the school, the poorer the overall passing rate became.  If the school was smaller (less than 2000 students), the school had a higher chance of getting their students to have a passing grade.

2. There was no correlation between the budget per student and the success the school would have with the overall passing rate.
