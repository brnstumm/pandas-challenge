- Utilized the many examples and practices from the class over the three days of instruction to complete the first 4 sections of the homework.

- Searched online for additional help to do some of the calculations.

- ran out of time for the second half of the assignment.  Too many errors that I couldn't address in the timeframe and with my limited knowledge of python (limited = 6 days of fast pace instruction).
- unable to preform any analysis on the data with my current state.
